# Pi native bootstrap patches

Donor: [earendil-works/pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/d5b3de22d0e24a3e9c38a9410d3329b099717283),
commit `d5b3de22d0e24a3e9c38a9410d3329b099717283`.
The audited `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core` and coding-agent packages are 1.4.0.
Preserve the donor MIT license and Mario Zechner copyright in `vendor/pi/LICENSE`.
Patch 0001 does not change dependencies or package manifests.

`0001-unavailable-readiness.patch` applies from the Splyce root to `vendor/pi/`.
It implements the bounded TD-07 unavailable-readiness seam of CF-01/02/06/08
([core-fusion contract](../../research/docs/design/core-fusion.md)); durable
admission and receipts remain TD-09/15/13 work.

The agent package exports one constant `assertSplyceReady` function. It always
throws an error whose fixed message and code are `SPLYCE_UNAVAILABLE`. There is no
activation setter, environment exception, receipt substitute or success path.
Future readiness must use the authoritative policy/store; transport handshake
flags cannot grant authority.

The same guard runs first in Agent prompt/continue, exported loop entrypoints and native tool
preparation, SDK/session-service creation, extension binding and resource loading/reloading, user-shell entry,
and model-runtime creation, refresh and request preparation. It retains Pi's
existing loop and hooks. Readiness errors propagate before effectful work;
ordinary tool error handling and provider result conversion remain in Pi. Agent
prompt/continue deny before lifecycle failure callbacks or continuation-queue
mutation, so an unavailable run cannot create a persisted failure transcript.

Regression entrypoints for `F0_pi_interception` are the loaded SDK, actual Agent
ordinary tool dispatch, direct loop/continuation calls, standalone/nested
`runToolCall`, resource-loader methods,
`AgentSession.bindExtensions`/`executeBash`, and `ModelRuntime` creation, refresh
and request dispatch. Assert fixed unavailable results and unchanged physical
sentinels, including argument-preparation callbacks. Removing a native guard must
fail its corresponding case. These checks do not qualify actual admission,
provider access, trusted-plugin containment or production readiness.

Source preparation checked the exact donor commit, clean patch application,
TypeScript syntax for all nine changed sources, and first-statement placement at
all seventeen guarded methods/functions. Full dependency-closure type/build and
loaded-runtime regressions belong to the integrated TD-07/11 candidate; their
final fork revision and results must be recorded before publication. Replay this
patch against the exact donor on upgrade, rerun those cases and retain the prior
source/artifact for rollback.

## Native tool admission

Apply `0002-native-tool-admission.patch` after the bootstrap patch. It changes
the shared `prepareToolCall`/`executePreparedToolCall` path and exports a host-only
tool-object binding. Unbound tools retain the unavailable guard; model arguments,
tool annotations and renderer readiness cannot create a binding. The production
SDK, provider, resource and user-shell entrypoints remain unavailable.

`packages/splyce-pi/src/policy.ts` uses the actual operational store for current
grant/revision checks, latest run/parent state, workspace epochs, exact argument
digests, decision/intent ordering and outcome persistence before completion. An
unresolved or previously used action is refused pending reconciliation. These
records share the existing ledger; there is no second conversation loop or store.

`tests/native-admission.test.mjs` exercises compiled Pi dispatch and physical
fixture bytes with actual SQLite failures, revocation during preparation, stale
ownership, terminal run/parent state, nested denial and process death after
durable intent. Isolated removal of native authority or intent persistence must
fail its corresponding physical assertion. The existing native entrypoint suite
continues to qualify default unavailability independently.

This is a native admission slice, not full TD-13 or production activation.
Atomic cross-process key reservation, qualified filesystem identity/race checks,
actual session/GUI/provider integration, redaction and owned process execution
remain required. Trusted in-process code retains direct OS authority. Reapply
all three patches on donor upgrades and rerun the physical and installed-app
gates before publishing a new candidate.

## Validated native tool preparation

`0008-validated-tool-preparation.patch` extends the owned Pi 1.4.0 admission seam.
Before argument callbacks, the native host atomically reserves the action identity
as a durable proposed record. Pi validates arguments, awaits native qualification,
then runs extension hooks. Failed or canceled preparation records a terminal state;
a failed terminal write leaves the proposal fenced. A matching local preparation
becomes executable only after successful hooks, and is consumed at dispatch.
Execution atomically checks the original proposed reservation before appending the
decision and intent. A reopened or competing policy cannot reuse the identity.

`AgentSession._executeNestedToolCall` forwards the actual parent tool-call ID.
The direct `NativePolicy` checks current grant, ownership, validated digest and
same-run/scope/workspace parent action. The parent must still be running. Native
errors reject; no grant minting or production readiness is enabled.

`tests/native-admission.test.mjs` exercises the loaded Pi tool path, reservation
and hook ordering, dynamic qualification, competing store handles, durable recovery,
nested ancestry, cancellation, revocation and actual SQLite failures with physical
fixture bytes. Guard-removal checks cover reservation, preparation, completion,
authority, intent and the atomic reservation precondition. SDK/GUI activation,
installed executor qualification and containment of trusted in-process callbacks
remain unverified.

## Pi HTTP client update

`0003-undici-8.12.3.patch` applies after the native admission patch. It updates
Pi's exact `undici` pin to 8.12.3, which includes the fix for
[GHSA-xjj6-f33q-929c](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/security/advisories/GHSA-xjj6-f33q-929c).
Regenerate and verify both npm lockfiles after applying it.

## 0004: provider credential option and errored tool calls (TD-20, TD-21)

`0004-provider-credentials-and-error-tool-calls.patch` applies from the Splyce root to `vendor/pi/`. It is an upstream-divergent
core patch to `packages/ai`, recorded here per [core fusion](../../research/docs/design/core-fusion.md).

- **Shared `credentials` option.** `src/splyce-credentials.ts` adds `SplyceCredentials { lease, redact }` (structural mirrors of the
  native `SecretLease` and `Redactor`, TD-16) and `StreamOptions.credentials`. The secret is taken from the lease for each use,
  never once: the Anthropic adapter builds its SDK client with a placeholder key and a fetch that leases the real key into
  `x-api-key` on every HTTP send (SDK retries included) and refuses redirects; the Google and Vertex adapters create their client
  inside `lease.use` for each request attempt. `apiKey` and `credentials` are mutually exclusive, a failing or revoked lease stops
  the next send or attempt, and credentials are refused before anything is leased unless the native `redact` is supplied; it is the
  only thing applied to `errorMessage`, so the adapters keep no copy of any secret. TD-19, TD-22 and TD-23 reuse the same helpers
  (`createLeasedFetch`, `withLeasedSecret`, `redactorOf`, `assertCredentialOptions`).
- **A lease cannot be mixed with another credential.** With `credentials`, a caller-supplied or model-configured auth header
  (`authorization`, `proxy-authorization`, `x-api-key`, `api-key`, `x-goog-api-key`, `cookie`, any letter case) is refused before
  anything is leased, because the pinned Google SDK prefers a header already present over its key; the Anthropic adapter refuses a
  caller-supplied SDK client (it carries its own auth and transport); and the Google/Vertex adapters refuse a payload hook that sets
  `httpOptions.baseUrl`, `headers`, `retryOptions`, `apiVersion` or `baseUrlResourceScope` (the endpoint, extra headers or SDK-level
  retries that would reuse one lease). `packages/ai/test/splyce-credentials-wire.test.ts` runs the pinned Anthropic and Google SDKs
  for real against local HTTP servers: exactly the leased key on the wire, a redirect is not followed on the Anthropic path, and a
  lease revoked after the first send stops the SDK retry. **Unresolved:** the pinned `@google/genai` calls the global fetch with its
  own options and follows redirects, so a redirect from the admitted Google/Vertex endpoint would carry `x-goog-api-key` along;
  those APIs therefore stay behind the native transport's final per-send check (TD-13) and this is recorded as a `todo` test.
- **Routing keeps the lease the only credential.** `buildBaseOptions` forwards `credentials` to the adapters (it used to drop
  it); `compat.ts` no longer injects an ambient env key beside a lease; `Models.applyAuth` skips stored, environment and
  provider-derived auth entirely when a lease is given (so no key, header or base URL from auth resolution can be mixed in or
  redirect the admitted endpoint); the Anthropic and Google simple wrappers skip their early API-key check for a lease; and an
  API outside `CREDENTIAL_APIS` (now anthropic-messages, google-generative-ai, google-vertex) refuses `credentials` instead of
  ignoring it, because ignoring it would fall back to an ambient key. Each adapter owner adds its API to the set when bound.
  Limits: within one Google/Vertex attempt the SDK holds the key until that attempt ends and its redirects are internal, so the
  native transport (TD-13) must still do the final per-send check there; Vertex application-default credentials are not
  covered by this option.
- **Lease-scoped redaction, API identity and observers.** A native redactor may only know the secret while the lease is active,
  so provider error text goes through `redactWithLease` (generic text if the lease is gone; there is no local fallback), and
  response headers and provider stream events are sanitized inside the lease (`redactResponseWithLease`, `redactEventWithLease`)
  before any `onResponse` / `onProviderStreamEvent` callback sees them. The credentials a call was admitted with are captured
  before `onPayload` runs, so a callback that mutates the caller's options cannot swap them. With native credentials every
  adapter refuses a model of another API (`assertCredentialApiIdentity`) before anything is leased, and fixed secret-free
  refusals throw `CredentialPreflightError`, which is never lease-redacted (zero lease uses, zero redactor calls). The
  `CREDENTIAL_APIS` set lives in `src/utils/model-operations.ts`. Regression tests: the family loops in
  `splyce-credentials.test.ts` (scoped redactor, wrong API, four pre-send refusals) fail if any of these guards is removed.
- **No tool calls from errored responses.** Anthropic returns a tool call only after its `content_block_stop`; a stream that ends
  with an unfinished tool call is an error, and the error path drops every tool call, finished or not. The Google and Vertex error paths drop all
  tool calls, so a malformed-function-call finish or a stream without a finish reason cannot reach dispatch.
- **Regression entrypoints.** `packages/ai/test/splyce-credentials.test.ts`, `splyce-anthropic-stream-safety.test.ts` and
  `splyce-google-stream-safety.test.ts` run the real adapters with only the vendor SDK boundary replaced. Removing the mutual
  exclusion, the redaction, or the error-path filtering fails the corresponding case.
- **Regression entrypoints** also include `splyce-credentials-routing.test.ts` (compat, Models layer, buildBaseOptions, unsupported
  APIs) and `splyce-provider-e2e.test.ts` (the real `NativeCredentialResolver` into the real adapters; revocation, abort,
  redaction, no fallback). Provider-specific admission, per-send endpoint rechecks on the Google/Vertex SDK paths and
  cancellation of the SDK transport belong to TD-13/TD-16 and the native transport.

## Native OpenAI request consumer

`0010-native-openai-consumer.patch` adds the owned Pi API consumer for the native
request-port contract. It consumes Chat Completions or Responses inside the
request lifetime, copies and redacts observer data, and waits for asynchronous
response cancellation before releasing the callback. It reuses the existing
auth-header preflight through an additive shared helper export. The refreshed
0006 patch also disables SDK logging and ambient SDK account metadata for
injected transports. See the
[consumer record](0010-native-openai-consumer.md) for patch order, local fixture
evidence and the remaining native/installed integration boundary.

## Pinned model data hydration

`0005-hydrate-pinned-model-catalog.patch` applies after patch 0003. It adds a
build-only `--hydrate-pinned` mode that fetches the existing
`nix/model-catalog.json` revision, verifies its content hash, and runs Pi's
existing hydrator without changing the pin. The Windows staging gate uses this
mode before its offline build; `tests/bootstrap/hydrate-pinned-model-data.test.mjs`
checks successful hydration, unavailable revisions, hash mismatches and pin
preservation (#77).

## Scoped owned readiness recovery

`0009-scoped-owned-readiness.patch` applies after 0008, against source snapshot
`58022c3`. It retains Pi 1.4.0 and upstream ancestry
`d5b3de22d0e24a3e9c38a9410d3329b099717283`.

Native weak identity bindings connect explicitly supplied SDK dependencies,
Agent options, initialized sessions, runners, tools and loop snapshots. The
private composition entrypoint does not change default unavailability. Tools
retain the current reservation, preparation, finish/discard and execution
lifecycle and original admitted implementation. Session disposal revokes derived
identities.

Changed fork symbols are `Agent.createLoopConfig`, the public loop entrypoints,
`prepareToolCall`, `executePreparedToolCall`, `finalizeExecutedToolCall`,
`AgentSession` construction/tool hooks/disposal/runtime binding,
`createAgentSession`, `ModelRuntime.create` and guarded provider/resource routes.
`splyce-readiness.ts` captures initialized Agent callbacks after session wrappers
and runtime setup, checks later replacements, and preserves callback ownership
through request and continuation snapshots. Awaited callbacks recheck current
ownership and cancellation before subsequent callbacks or effects. Streaming
loop failures reach both iteration and `result()`. Subscriber and tool progress
callbacks also recheck ownership and cancellation. Interrupted runs retain local
failure state without invoking failure subscribers or adding failure transcript
entries; still-current ordinary failures retain event reporting.

`tests/native-owned-session.test.mjs` loads the actual SDK and native tool
implementation, writes physical fixture bytes through real SQLite admission,
checks foreign/disposed identities and callback replacement, and exercises
revocation/cancellation during request, conversion, credential, tool and
continuation hooks. Mutation checks require physical assertions to fail when
callback or direct-tool guards are removed. Existing native entrypoint and
admission suites retain their guard-removal checks.

The fixture creates its own owner and demonstrates scoped APIs only. No
production factory, installed GUI readiness, provider admission, resource
selection, credential lifecycle or executor containment is qualified. Trusted
in-process code retains OS authority. Reapply against the exact owned source
and rerun these regressions after donor or wrapper changes.
